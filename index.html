                                     <p>
                                            I am an Aspiring Web Developer, Husband, Father, Soldier and Certified Occupational Therapy Assistant.
                                      </p>
                            
                                
                                      <p>
                                          Born in the mountains of North Carolina I have an appreciation for the outdoors. I am happiest when enjoying Mother Natures beauty whether it is in the mountains of Western North Carolina, or right here at home while fishing of Lake Norman.
                                          As an Occupational Therapy Assistant, I specialize in working with the Geriatric population with the goal of achieving 
                                          Independence with all of their Activities of Daily Living.  I take pride in my interpersonal skills, my ability to work within a Skilled Nursing Facility and providing the just "right challenge " for 
                                          the needs of my patients.
                                      </p>
                                
                                       <p>
                                           I am also a proud member of the United States Army Reserves.  My military career has taken me around the world, from conducting combat operations beside the Euphrates River in Iraq, to training new Army Recruits 
                                           at Fort Jackson, South Carolina.  The military has sharpened my skills as a leader as well as working as a member of a team to complete any assigned mission.  
                                
                                       </p>
